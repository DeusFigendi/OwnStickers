## Special Purposes

In this directory I'll put those stickers with some special "idea"
how and where to use it. Every idea has some kind of story I'll try to
tell here:

### bankey

Bankey or "ban keyboard" was the idea to create a keyboard where all the
keys say "ban" (and some "massban") as a joke for folks moderating chats
or similar.
I didn't need sooo many "ban" so I added some funny other icons to it
just to make keyboards a little funnier.
I printed these on transparent transfer stickers to use it on a blank
black keyboard. But if you allready have a full printed keyboard it
might be more usefull to have black background instead of transparent
so you can put it over the Ctrl or F2 or whatever.

### HomoeopathieWirkt

This sticker is meant to be put aside to typical doctors name plates
if it contains "Hom√∂opathie". This way the plate gets more honest.


### Freifunk IP

The idea is to put these on your Freifunk router and write down its
IP adress. So you can go there physical to access the router. The IP
is pre-printed for IPs in the range the Freifunk Lippe uses. And so the
logo is also for Freifunk-Lippe.
