## My Stickers

over the years I designed different stickers. Some might be interesting
for other some ain't. But those which might be interesting I put into
this repository.

Unfortunaly not all designs are "free" so sometimes I used to use unfree
material. In those cases I don't publish them here, I'm sorry.

Often I do copyright notes inside the .svg-files so if you need to know,
check there. If your questions ain't answered feel free to open an issue
and I will see if I can find out or remeber about the licenses.

If you need a special license (likeâ€¦ you need it in GFDL or something)
also feel free to ask I'll add it if that it legal.
